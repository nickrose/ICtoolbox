====================================

For out-of-the-box functionality on

 - Simulated two-channel data, use: 'mcInfoCriterionTest.m' and create reusable scenarios with ID numbers in 'loadParamsScenTest.m'
 
 - Collected data (real or complex-proper), use: 'infoCriterion.m' - this is the main information criteria function which the above simulated data generator calls
 
For further information on how to use these functions, use the matlab help command, or see the code preamble.

====================================

The key to the various Information Criteria is the following:
AIC, BIC:
	Akaike, Bayesian  IC
	(Bayesian IC is also known as MDL (minimum description length) criterion)
AIC_fsFit, BIC_fsFit:
	AIC and BIC for the two-channel 'full signal' fit
AIC_jointXFit, BIC_jointXFit:
	AIC and BIC for the two-channel 'cross term' fit
AIC_indv, BIC_indv:
	AIC and BIC for the fit of each channel individually (non-joint solution)
AIC_crossOnly, BIC_crossOnly: 
	AIC and BIC for the cross fit only, not consider the PCA reduction of the individual channels
